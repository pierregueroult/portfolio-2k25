# Selenite: Lost Contact - The Website

<NoTranslation />

## Introduction

The website for _Selenite: Lost Contact_ plays a key role in our project. It is not just a simple showcase site but a full-fledged platform that enhances and complements the game experience.

The primary objective is to highlight _Selenite: Lost Contact_, inform players about its universe, and, most importantly, encourage them to download the game. Therefore, we designed an immersive, dynamic, and interactive website that reflects the game's visual identity and offers comprehensive content.

In this article, we will detail the design choices, the technologies used, the development process, and how the website integrates into the overall strategy of the project.

## Creating an Engaging and Immersive Experience

### Homepage and Building Anticipation

From the moment visitors arrive, they are greeted by a **large countdown timer** displaying the game's release date. This central element creates anticipation and a sense of urgency, encouraging players to follow the project closely.

### Progressive Immersion into the Game's Universe

The site offers an **interactive 3D animation** created using Three.js, displaying the Moon and Alex Carter's spaceship in the background. This scene reacts to scrolling and user interactions, providing a more engaging experience than a static website.

## Development Process

### Planning and Prototyping

The development of the _Selenite: Lost Contact_ website began with a meticulous **planning and prototyping phase**. Before writing a single line of code, we focused on:

- **Defining user experience (UX) principles** to ensure intuitive navigation.
- **Creating wireframes and mockups** to establish a clear structure.
- **Iterating on designs** with feedback from team members and potential users.

### Agile Development Approach

We adopted an **agile methodology**, breaking development into several sprints. Each sprint focused on implementing key features:

1. **Basic Structure & Navigation** - Setting up Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
2. **3D Interactivity & Animations** - Integrating React Three Fiber for immersive elements.
3. **Dynamic Content & Backend** - Connecting MongoDB with Prisma.
4. **Performance Optimization & SEO** - Improving loading times and accessibility.
5. **Final Testing & Deployment** - Ensuring smooth operation across all devices.

## Accessibility and Multi-Device Adaptation

- The download link adapts based on the user's platform (PC, Mac, or mobile).

### Ensuring Accessibility

Accessibility was a priority, with features such as:

- **Optimized contrast** for better readability.
- **Proper text sizing** to reduce visual strain.
- **Keyboard navigation support** for users with disabilities.

## Technologies Used

We utilized a modern and high-performance tech stack:

### **Next.js**
