# Selenite: Lost Contact - The Website

<NoTranslation />

## Introduction

The website for _Selenite: Lost Contact_ plays a key role in our project. It is not just a simple showcase site but a full-fledged platform that enhances and complements the game experience.

The primary objective is to highlight _Selenite: Lost Contact_, inform players about its universe, and, most importantly, encourage them to download the game. Therefore, we designed an immersive, dynamic, and interactive website that reflects the game's visual identity and offers comprehensive content.

In this article, we will detail the design choices, the technologies used, the development process, and how the website integrates into the overall strategy of the project.

## Creating an Engaging and Immersive Experience

### Homepage and Building Anticipation

From the moment visitors arrive, they are greeted by a **large countdown timer** displaying the game's release date. This central element creates anticipation and a sense of urgency, encouraging players to follow the project closely.
