# Discord Univ Calendars: A Smart Bot for University Schedules 

<NoTranslation />

## 📌 Project Overview  

University schedules can be a hassle to check, often requiring multiple steps through clunky online portals. **Discord Univ Calendars** solves this problem by bringing schedules directly to students via **Discord**.  

This bot allows students from **MMI (Multimedia and Internet Professions)** and **RT (Networks and Telecommunications)** at **IUT of Rouen (Elbeuf campus)** to quickly access their weekly schedules without leaving their favorite communication platform. Instead of manually looking up their timetables, they can simply use a **slash command** and instantly retrieve the relevant information.  

By integrating real-time updates and ensuring the data remains accurate, this project significantly improves accessibility for students, reducing the friction of schedule management.

## 🔧 Key Features  

- **Instant access to schedules**: Retrieve the current week's schedule or request a specific date.  
- **Slash command integration**: Simple and efficient interaction via Discord's built-in command system.  
- **Automatic updates**: Ensures that the schedules remain up-to-date without manual intervention.  
- **Optimized for student needs**: Designed with ease of use in mind to provide a **frictionless experience**.  
- **Robust error handling**: Prevents outdated or incorrect information from being displayed.

## 💻 Technologies Used  

Building a reliable bot required a **solid tech stack** to ensure efficiency and responsiveness:  

- **Node.js** - The core language for developing the bot.  
- **Discord.js** - A powerful library for interacting with Discord's API.  
- **Prisma** - ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for managing database queries efficiently.  
- **Automated fetch system** - Ensures data is updated dynamically.

## ⚡ Challenges & Solutions  

### 🔹 Ensuring Reliable Data Fetching  

University schedules can change frequently, and outdated information could cause confusion. To handle this, I implemented an **automated data retrieval system** that regularly fetches and updates schedules in the database. This guarantees that users always receive the most accurate information available.  

### 🔹 User-Friendly Interaction  

Since many students are not familiar with bot commands, I focused on making interactions as intuitive as possible. Using **slash commands**, students can retrieve their schedules with minimal effort. Commands like `/schedule` and `/schedule week X` make navigation easy and quick.  

### 🔹 Performance Optimization  

Given that many students might request their schedules simultaneously, the bot needed to be **efficient and scalable**. Using **Prisma** for database queries improved performance by allowing quick lookups, while caching mechanisms reduced redundant API calls.

## 📈 Impact & Lessons Learned  

Developing **Discord Univ Calendars** provided valuable insights into **API development, database management, and third-party service integration**. More importantly, it reinforced the importance of **building tools tailored to user needs**.  

### 🚀 What I Learned:  
- How to efficiently fetch and process external data for real-time updates.  
- The importance of **UX design in command-line interfaces**, ensuring ease of use.  
- Optimizing API requests to balance performance and reliability.  

This project successfully demonstrated how automation can **streamline everyday tasks**, making important information more **accessible and user-friendly**.
