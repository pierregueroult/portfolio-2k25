# Energy Dashboard: An Interactive Visualization of Electricity Consumption

<NoTranslation />

## Context and Objectives

This project was developed as part of a **SAE (Situation d'Apprentissage et d'Ã‰valuation)** for the **BUT MMI** program. The goal was to create an interactive dashboard displaying the electricity consumption of a given department based on provided CSV data.

Instead of limiting the dashboard to a single department, I enhanced the project by collecting **all available CSV files**, storing the data in a **database**, and allowing users to select any department dynamically.

## Technologies Used

The project was built using the following technologies:

- **PHP** (server-side processing and API endpoints)
- **Chart.js** (interactive data visualization)
- **AJAX** (dynamic updates without page reloads)
- **Tailwind CSS** (modern UI styling)

## Dynamic Data Updates with AJAX

One of the main challenges was ensuring that the **charts update dynamically** when selecting a new department, without requiring a full page reload. This was achieved using **AJAX requests** to fetch updated data and redraw the charts in real-time.

### Example of AJAX Implementation

Below is the main JavaScript function handling data fetching and updating the UI dynamically:

```javascript
async function loadCharts(department) {
  // Check if department data is available
  try {
    const res = await fetch("/sae303/api/test.php?department=" + department);
    const { status } = await res.json();
    if (status === false) {
      throw new Error("The department is not available");
    }
  } catch (e) {
    window.alert("Il semblerait que toutes les bases de donnÃ©es nÃ©cessaires ne soient pas disponibles ... ");
    return;
  }

  // Update department summary cards
  const cards = document.querySelectorAll("[data-cards]");
  cards.forEach(async (card, i) => {
    const legend = card.querySelector("dt");
    const value = card.querySelector("dd");
    const aside = card.querySelector("aside");
    const ratio = card.querySelector("span");
    const svg = card.querySelectorAll("svg");

    const res = await fetch(`/sae303/api/cards?department=${department}&index=${i + 1}`);
    const { data } = await res.json();

    aside.classList.remove("positive", "negative", "text-green-500", "text-red-500");
    legend.innerText = data.legend;
    value.innerText = Math.round(data.info) + " " + data.unit;
    ratio.innerText = Math.round(data.ratio * 100) / 100 + "%";

    aside.classList.add(data.ratio > 0 ? "positive" : "negative");
    aside.classList.add(data.ratio > 0 ? "text-green-500" : "text-red-500");
  });

  // Fetch and update charts
  var res = await fetch("/sae303/api/charts/consoByYear.php?department=" + department);
  var { data } = await res.json();
  drawConsoByYear(data);

  await loadYearlyCharts(department, 2021);

  var res = await fetch("/sae303/api/charts/typeOfProduction.php?department=" + department);
  var { data } = await res.json();
  drawTypeOfProduction(data);

  var res = await fetch("/sae303/api/charts/regionByMonth.php?department=" + department);
  var { data } = await res.json();
  drawRegionByMonth(data);

  var res = await fetch("/sae303/api/charts/prodByMonth.php?department=" + department);
  var { data } = await res.json();
  drawProdByMonth(data);
}
```

### How It Works:

- First, the function **checks if the selected department's data is available**.
- It then **updates the summary cards** showing key statistics.
- Finally, it **fetches new chart data** and redraws each visualization accordingly.

## UI & Design Considerations

To create a **modern and consistent UI**, I took inspiration from **ShadCN/UI** for layout and design coherence, without directly using its components. The dashboard features a clean and accessible interface with a focus on **clarity and responsiveness**.

## Challenges & Learning Outcomes

- **Data Processing**: Automating CSV imports into a structured **database**.
- **Dynamic UX**: Implementing real-time updates via AJAX for a **smooth user experience**.
- **UI Consistency**: Creating a visually appealing design while maintaining **accessibility** standards.

## Results & Final Grade

The final project was **well-received** and earned a **high grade**, validating both its **technical robustness** and **user experience**.

## Conclusion

This project was an excellent exercise in **data manipulation, frontend/backend integration, and UX design**. It demonstrated how a relatively simple dataset could be transformed into an **interactive and insightful tool** through effective web development practices.
