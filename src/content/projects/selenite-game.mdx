# Selenite: Lost Contact - My contribution to the game development

<NoTranslation />

*Selenite: Lost Contact* is an ambitious game project that required a solid development infrastructure. My role in this project focused on setting up and managing the GitHub repository, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring smooth release management.

## Setting Up the GitHub Repository

To facilitate collaboration, I created the main repository for the game on the [Selenite GitHub organization](https://github.com/selenite-live/). This repository serves as the central hub for contributions, issue tracking, and project organization.

## Implementing CI/CD for Automated Builds & Releases

One of the most critical aspects of the development workflow was automating the build and release process. I implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to build the game for both Windows and macOS. This setup ensures that every new release is built, packaged, and published automatically.

### CI/CD Pipeline

Below is the GitHub Actions script used for building and releasing the game:

```yaml
name: Build the game Windows & MacOS 🎮

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  actions: write
  contents: write
  packages: write
  releases: write

jobs:
  init-data:
    name: Set the workflow data 📊
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      builder_number: ${{ steps.builder_number.outputs.build_number }}
      date: ${{ steps.set_date.outputs.date }}
    steps:
      - name: Get the number of the current build
        id: builder_number
        uses: einaregilsson/build-number@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Get the current date for the build name
        id: set_date
        run: echo "::set-output name=date::$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')"

## Managing Releases

With the CI/CD pipeline in place, every build is automatically packaged and published as a new release on GitHub. This ensures that developers and testers always have access to the latest stable version of the game.

The release workflow:
- Detects new changes pushed to the `release` branch
- Builds the game for both Windows and macOS
- Uploads the build artifacts
- Publishes a new GitHub release with versioning
