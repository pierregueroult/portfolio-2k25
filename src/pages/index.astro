  <p>
    20 year-old web developer & Computer Science Student. I love crafting sleek websites and automating workflows to make life easier.
    Passionate about clean code, problem-solving, and making tech work smarter, not harder. Always exploring new
    technologies, always up for a challenge. Whether it's web development, automation, or something completely out of my
    comfort zone - I'm in.
