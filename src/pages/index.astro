    20 year-old web developer & Computer Science Student. I love crafting sleek websites and automating workflows to
    make life easier. Passionate about clean code, problem-solving, and making tech work smarter, not harder. Always
    exploring new technologies, always up for a challenge. Whether it's web development, automation, or something
    completely out of my comfort zone - I'm in.
